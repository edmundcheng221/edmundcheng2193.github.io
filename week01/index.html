                Week 1 - Berger Text Response

                The fourth video really resonated with me. I remember the scene where he showed pages in a magazine. In
                one page, the publisher/writer/photographer shows images of people struggling. However, when you turn the page,
                you see an advertisment for something like Coca-Cola. 
        
            
                I think what Berger is trying to suggest is that when people see the first image, they subconsciously think that 
                the struggles people face in other countries will not ever affect them personally. However, when they see the second image, 
                they subconsciously connect that to the reality they live in.
                

                This made me really think about the disconnect between advertisments and the real world. It emphasizes the feeling
                of inadequecy that people face today. People live in a dream. When people see adverstisments regarding luxury items, people think that their lives would be better
                if they buy what the adverstisment is trying to sell. However, when people see articles about struggles, people tend to disassociate
                what is depicted to their own lives. Perhaps I misinterpeted what Berger meant, but this is what I think he meant at least.

                I agree with everything Berger is suggesting. This video really made me think a little more about how the adverising
                industry works.
