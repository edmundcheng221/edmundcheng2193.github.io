            There are unconfirmed reports that Belson violated Hooli protocols in the acquisition of a company
            that contained toxic assets. Belson acquired PiperChat, formerly Pied Piper, in hopes of gaining control of
            their compression algorithm.

        <article>
            A large part of the problem with PiperChat is that it is in violation of COPPA (Children's Online Privacy
            and Protection Act). This act establishes strict guidelines to protect the privacy of younger children on the 
            internet. Each violation of COPPA carries a penalty of $16,000 each use.

            It appears that 33% of PiperChat's user base were children under the age of 13. It is also apparent that there 
            are no parental permission requirements in place. Based on the number of times this application was used by children 
            under the age of 13, the toxic assets amount to over $21 Billion in COPPA fines.

        <article> 
            To that end, executives at Hooli voted to remove Belson effective immediately. Executives are currently looking for
            legal defences which would potentially leave Belson liable for all fees and damages.

            Belson will be succeeded by 'Action' Jack Barker, A veteran tech CEO, Barker commented "we at Hooli
            pledge to work with the Federal Trade Commision to resolve this matter and commit ourselves to earning
            back the public trust."
