            Gain Belson, CEO of Hooli, met with Dinesh Chugtai, CEO of PiperChat, regarding the possiblility of 
            acquiring Chugtai's company. Chugtai mentions in their conversation that PiperChat, formerly Pied Piper, contains
            toxic assets and that Belson and Hooli should tread softly. Belson states to media that this was simply an 
            empty threat and that Hooli will move at warp speed to aquire said company.

            Although Chugtai was reluctant to sign off his company, "Chad" Belson was able to seal in the deal. Belson reads Chugtai 
            media articles where he stated clearly that PiperChat is an improvement on Hooli's HooliChat and that their algorithms are 
            derivatives of HooliChat. Belson threatened to take legal action suing PiperChat for intellectual property theft. However, if 
            PiperChat agrees to sign off on the acquisition forms, Belson would drop all charges. PiperChat complied.

            Chugtai will be required to sign off and relinquish all assets related to PiperChat within 3 business days.
            PiperChat, within 3 business days, would be a child company of Hooli. PiperChat's compression and video meeting
            application could potentially be incorporated into HooliChat's existing platform.
