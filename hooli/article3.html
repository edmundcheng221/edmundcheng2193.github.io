            Nelson Bighetti, 26, was raised in Arizona, United States. He attended Arizona State University for 5 years.
            Because of his genius and the coursework not being challenging enough, Bighetti averaged a C grade in all of his
            undergraduate courses. He dropped out of university and begin working at Hooli as a Software Engineer.

            Nelson Bighetti is a passionate entrepeneur. He is skilled at many technologies. In fact, he would categorize himself
            as a "jack of all trades." He lived in a hostel with the engineers at Pied Piper where he worked on developing "Nip Alert,"
            a GPS-driven application designed to give you the location of women with erect nipples.

            There are unconfirmed reports that Bighetti is the true founder and brains behind Pied Piper, a compression company that
            scored a Weissman Score of 2.89 by means of a middle-out compression algorithm. The Weissman score is an efficiency metric
            for lossless compression algorithms. A Weissman Score as low as 2.89 has never been seen before which makes this an incredible
            breakthrough and the reason why Pied Piper is so highly valued.

            Bighetti is also the leader in major projects such as the "Potato Cannon" and a "Piezoelectric Sensor Project," a device 
            that would allow users to control their HooliPhone using their neuro impulses. As a result of his incredible achivements
            coupled with his past accomplishments, Bighetti will be on the cover of WIRED Magazine.
