            Breaking news: Hooli is proceeding with taking legal action against Pied Piper. Pied Piper is a compression algorithm
            start-up that recently entered in Tech Crunch Disrupt and won with flying colors by achieving a Weissman Score of 2.89.
            The Weissman score is an efficiency metric for lossless compression algorithms. A Weissman Score as low as 2.89 has never been seen before which makes this an incredible
            breakthrough and the reason why Pied Piper is so highly valued.

            Data compression and achieving a low Weissman Score is crucial in society because as technology becomes more and more
            advanced, the company that can compress and handle the most data would become on top. A good compression algorithm would be
            needed in order to handle a seemingly infinite amount of data.

        <article>
            There are unconfirmed reports that Pied Piper did not achieve such a good algorithm all by themselves. There are unconfirmed reports
            that Pied Piper employees have used Hooli technology in the early stages of Pied Piper. Thus, Pied Piper should be sole property 
            of Hooli Corporation.

            Nelson Bighetti, true mastermind behind Pied Piper, will be expected to appear in court to deliver his statements regarding
            this matter. Bighetti will confirm suspicions and would aid in Hooli's rightful acquision of Pied Piper.
