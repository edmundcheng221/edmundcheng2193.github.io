            Gavin Belson, CEO of Hooli, put together a bright team of engineers working on their new product called "Nucleus."
            Nucleus seeks to incorporate a middle-out compression algorithm into the whole sweep of Hooli apps. These
            apps include: HooliMaps, HooliSheets, HooliDocs, HooliChat, etc. Belson is very enthusiastic about this new product.

            Most recently, Hooli has figured out a method to incorporate Nusclus into their HooliPhones. Nucleus would be the
            newest operating system supported by the HooliPhones. Nucleus OS is expected to make the HooliPhones more efficient and
            user friendly. Last Week, Hooli gathered a focus group to review the product.

            The focus group was given 90 minutes to explore a standard HooliPhone upgraded with a brand new operating system called 
            Nucleus. The focus group shared their first impressions. They made the following statements.

            <ul>Ramón: "It's just stupid."</ul>
            <ul>Moderator: "Okay. Ramón feels the phone is stupid. Could you elaborate, Ramón? Stupid how? Please be as specific as possible."</ul>
            <ul>Ramón: "Well it's slow. The apps keep quitting on me. I tried to watch a movie, and it kept freezing up. And when I'm typing, there's a delay. Then all the letters pop up at once. You took a good phone and made it all shitty."</ul>
            <ul>Moderator: "Keep in mind I didn't design the phone."</ul>
            <ul>Ramón: "It pissed me off."</ul>
            <ul>Moderator: "Who else feels this product is stupid?"</ul>
            <ul>Moderator: "Alan, Lisa, Josh, Yanna, Katie."</ul>
            <ul>Moderator: "And did this piss anyone else off?"</ul>
            <ul>Moderator: "Alan, Lisa, Josh, Yanna, Katie."</ul>

            Upon listening to this focus group, the team at Hooli agreed that Nucleus OS is Apple Maps bad.
            More updates on the Neuclus OS will be released soon.
